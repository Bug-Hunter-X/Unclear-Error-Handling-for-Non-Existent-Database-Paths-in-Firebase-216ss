This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult-to-debug issue in Firebase: unclear error handling when accessing non-existent or restricted database paths.  The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the problematic code that attempts to read from a non-existent path. The `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a solution which includes robust error handling and input validation to prevent such issues.
