The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you attempt to access a database path that does not exist, or if the rules prevent access. This can be particularly tricky to debug because the error messages aren't always clear.  For example, trying to read data from a non-existent path might result in a null value instead of a clear error, making it difficult to identify the source of the problem during development. This is common when working with deeply nested data structures where one level might accidentally be omitted.
