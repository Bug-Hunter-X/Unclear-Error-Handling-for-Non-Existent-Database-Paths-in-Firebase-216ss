The solution involves explicitly checking for the existence of the data path before attempting to access it.  This can be achieved using a transaction or by first fetching the data path to check if it exists, and then proceed with the read operation only if it does.  Example:

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('users/user123/profile').once('value', (snapshot) => {
  if (snapshot.exists()) {
    // Proceed to read data
    const userData = snapshot.val();
    // ... process data ...
  } else {
    console.error('User profile not found');
    // Handle the case where the user profile doesn't exist
  }
});
```
This approach ensures that the application gracefully handles cases where expected data is missing, improving overall robustness.
